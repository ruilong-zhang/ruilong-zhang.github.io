I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the City University of Hong Kong, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/). Previously, I was an undergrad in Computer Science and Technology at the Hefei University of Technology.

During grad school, I visited the University of Macau, where I was working with Prof. [Xiaowei Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/wxw0711/). I also visited Carnegie Mellon University, where I was working with Prof. [Ben Moseley](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/) and Prof. [Sungjin Im](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/sim3/). I was also a visiting student at the University of Hamburg, working with Prof. [Peter Kling](https://academic.pkling.de/).


Research Interests
======
My main research area is algorithm design which is part of theoretical computer science. Specifically, I am interested in designing efficient algorithms with provable guarantees for problems arising from machine learning, artificial intelligence, and economic computations. Some particular models I am investigating are scheduling, fair division, and online problems with predictions. More broadly, I am interested in approximation algorithms and combinatorial optimization.

Preprints:
------

    Under review in Algorithmica, 2021.
Conferences:
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

Journals:
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
