I am currently a postdoc in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University at Buffalo, where I am working with Prof. [Shi Li](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~shil/). 

Previously, I was a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the City University of Hong Kong, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/). Before that, I was an undergrad in Computer Science and Technology at the Hefei University of Technology.

During grad school, I visited the University of Macau, where I was working with Prof. [Xiaowei Wu](https://sites.google.com/site/wxw0711/). I also visited Carnegie Mellon University, where I was working with Prof. [Ben Moseley](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/) and Prof. [Sungjin Im](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/sim3/). I was also a visiting student at the University of Hamburg, working with Prof. [Peter Kling](https://academic.pkling.de/).

More information can be found in my [CV](/files/CV.pdf) (Last updated: Dec 03, 2022).

Here is my [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/233/6329.html).


Research Interests
======
My main research area is algorithm design which is part of theoretical computer science. Specifically, I am interested in designing efficient algorithms with provable guarantees for problems arising from machine learning, artificial intelligence, and economic computations. Some particular models I am investigating are scheduling, fair division, and online problems with predictions. More broadly, I am interested in approximation algorithms and combinatorial optimization.


Publications
======
Per convention of the community, authors of a paper in TCS conference proceedings or journals have equal contribution and are sorted alphabetically.
