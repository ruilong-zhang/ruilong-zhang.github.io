I am currently an incoming postdoc at the University of Toronto. Previously, I was a postdoc in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University at Buffalo, where I was advised by Prof. [Shi Li]. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the City University of Hong Kong, where I was supervised by Prof. [Minming Li]. Before that, I was an undergrad in Computer Science and Technology at the Hefei University of Technology.

During my grad school and postdoc, I was a long-term visitor at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked with Prof. [Ben Moseley] and Prof. [Sungjin Im]. I was also a short-term visitor in [Theory Group](https://tcs.nju.edu.cn/) at Nanjing University, in Prof. [Xiaowei Wu]'s group at the University of Macau, in Prof. [Peter Kling]'s group at the University of Hamburg.

Here is my [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/233/6329.html).


Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in algorithm design and analysis for combinatorial optimization problems. More specifically, I aim to design approximation and online algorithms with worst-case guarantees under different computational models: offline, online, computational economics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
* Approximation and Online Algorithms on Combinatorial Optimization <br />
* Scheduling and Network Design <br />
* Algorithmic Fairness; Multiagent System; Machine Learning Foundations <br />


Publications
======
Per convention of the TCS community, authors of a paper in conference proceedings or journals have equal contributions and are sorted alphabetically.
